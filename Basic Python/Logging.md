This logging module is used to print things (logs) out, either to a console or to a file

A log is a documented record of everything that you desire to capture as your app is running.

For example, the log of each day is a record of event that happened each day that you desire to be documented.

The logger is meant to be used across multiple files, even though itâ€™s created in one, in particular.
